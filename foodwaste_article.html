        According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, “roughly
        one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year —
        approximately 1.3 billion tonnes — gets lost or wasted” (Food and Agricultural
        Organization, 2019). Food waste is a not only a huge economic loss. Food waste is
        also a major issue when many around the globe die of starvation and is a large
        contributor to global warming.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        When food goes into the landfill without the presence of oxygen, it starts to break
        down through anaerobic decomposition and releases landfill gas (LFG) as a byproduct,
        which is mainly composed of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) (Environmental
        Protection Agency, July 2019). Both methane and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases,
        which means they trap heat in the atmosphere, but “CH<sub>4</sub> [methane] is more efficient at
        trapping radiation than CO<sub>2</sub> [carbon dioxide]” (Environmental Protection Agency, April 2019).
        This means methane is a more dangerously potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and thus
        makes food waste that ends up in the landfill a major contributor to global warming.

        There are other hidden costs that surface before our food gets to our plate. First of all,
        factories and farms have to be built, which leads to deforestation and the loss of natural
        habitats for many organisms. Secondly, to cultivate crops, lots of pesticides and water are
        used, and the runoff of fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus can seep into our groundwater
        or cause harmful algal blooms. Nitrogen and phosphorus create ideal conditions for algae to grow,
        but algae consume a lot of oxygen (thus making the pond hypoxic) and suffocate other organisms
        in the pond (Clear Choices, n.d.). Lastly, food from the farm needs to be packaged and sent to
        distribution centers, sometimes even several of them, before they arrive at your local supermarket.
        The transportation of food and the operation of these centers require the combustion of fossil fuels
        and release even more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

        What can we do about this? The best way to prevent food waste is to only buy what you need. If we stop
        purchasing that extra, uneaten bag of potato chips, we prevent the environmental effects that brought
        that item to our home and ultimately to the landfill in the first place.
        <br><br>

        Composting is most ideal for leftover apple stems, orange peels, and rotten peaches, which can prevent
        inedible food contents from ending up in landfills. Composting allows us to turn and thus aerate the
        contents to aerobically decompose and return the organic matter to our soil, which prevents the methane
        production from anaerobic decomposition (Global Composting Solutions). Of course, we cannot compost everything
        and not everyone has a compost bin although <a href="https://www.diyncrafts.com/33618/home/gardening/35-cheap-easy-diy-compost-bins-can-build-weekend" target="_blank">
        DIY & Crafts</a> suggests that it is certainly easy to create one at home!

        Here are some extra tips to help you reduce your food waste:
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start with a grocery shopping list</strong> — Sticking to a plan can help you not buy any extra items. We tend
          to come out of the grocery store with much more than we expected. Some things you can do are plan your meals
          beforehand and read your grocery store’s weekly ad beforehand so you can anticipate what sales there are.<br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Purchase locally sourced foods</strong> — Going to a farmer’s markets is a great way to purchase locally sourced
          foods. It not only cuts on transportation emissions and supports local businesses but also gets you fresh food. Many farms
           have pick-your-own berries and apples, which can be a fun activity. In addition, some supermarkets have signs mentioning
           that a particular product was sourced locally. <br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Use your own judgment with expiration dates</strong> — The expiration dates are there to ensure that the food is
          at the best quality up to that date. However, it is not a complete indicator of the actual conditions of the food. If a food
          item expired a day or two ago, use your judgment and decide whether you can or cannot eat it. <br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Compost leftover fruits and vegetables</strong> — Food waste is not completely preventable, but we can prevent most food from
          ending up in landfills. <a href=https://learn.eartheasy.com/guides/composting/ target="_blank">Eartheasy's Composting Guide</a>
          has some extra tips on what you can or cannot compost and how to compost successfully. <br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Use a food reduction or food sharing app</strong> — These apps allow restaurants to sell any extra, unsold food they made
          for the day at a discounted price or help a user track how much food the user has thrown out. Check out <a href="https://impakter.com/food-waste-apps/" target="_blank">
