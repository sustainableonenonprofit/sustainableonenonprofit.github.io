    <h2 class="post-title">Our GoFundMe to Save Australian Wildlife</h2>
    <p class="post-para">
       <strong>Goal</strong>: Raise $3000 for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)
       <br><br>
       Since November 2019, the Australian bushfires have destroyed many natural habitats.
       Australia needs your help. With our mission to protect our environment, we created
       <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/taev2-sustainable039s-campaign-for-ifaw">this GoFundMe</a> to help our wildlife friends in Australia!
       <br><br>
       As a thank you for your support...<br>
       <strong>Donations of $10 or more</strong> will receive a <strong>laminated koala sticker</strong><br>
       <strong>Donations of $50 or more</strong> will also receive a <strong>koala tote bag</strong>
       <br><br>
       ***<strong>Important Note</strong>: Please be sure to send us a message with your address! Stickers & tote bags
       can only be shipped to addresses in continental United States.***
       <br><br>
       All proceeds will be directly donated to the <strong>International Fund for Animal Welfare</strong> (IFAW), a nonprofit organization.
       IFAW uses the donations to supply food and purchase veterinary supplies for koalas, kangaroos, and other animals rescued from the bushfires.
       You can read more about the organization on their website <a href="https://www.ifaw.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
       <br><br>
       Please help us reach our goal by sharing this fundraiser! Any amount donated is greatly appreciated!
       We can make a difference with your help.
