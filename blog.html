    <p class="post-para">
       Thank you so much for a successful 2019! We recently donated the amounts fundraised from our 2019 events to the Association
       to Preserve Cape Cod. We couldn't have done it without you!
       <br><br>
       We will most definitely be working extra hard on our environmental efforts this year. Stay tuned to find out what events
       we have in store for 2020.

    <p class="post-para">

       Welcome to <i>Sustainable One's</i> Blog!

       Our environment matters, and through our youth campaign to spread
       environmental awareness and fundraise to support organizations focused on
       saving the environment. We need your help in making our mission successful.

       <br><br>
       Our blog will update you with news and
       stories! Subscribe to our newsletter to see when there is a new posting and to find out
       how you can decrease your carbon footprint.

       <br><br>
       Some things we have planned include creating helpful infographics on environmental
       facts and publishing blog posts. We are working on making the website
       as user-friendly as possible, so stick around!

       <br><br>
       It only takes one idea to start a movement. <i>Sustainable One</i> hopes to encourage
       everyone to live a more sustainable life. We CAN do something.
