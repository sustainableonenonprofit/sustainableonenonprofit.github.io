      <h4>The Development of the EPA<br></h4>
      <p>
      The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) strives to consolidate environmental responsibilities in every aspect. Originating in the 1970s, the idea of the EPA was proposed by the president of the time, Richard Nixon, in response to the rising concern of water and air pollution in the wake of disasters. It was approved by the House and the Senate on December 4, 1970, and William Ruckelshaus took office. The goal of the EPA was mainly to research pollutants, monitor the condition of the environment, and establish environmental baselines. Since the establishment, the EPA has removed great amounts of toxic waste, regulated the ozone layer, increased recycling, and more to provide cleaner air, purer water, and a safe environment for the world. It continues to provide stability for our environment and play an important factor in improving our environment every step of the way.

      <h4>The Establishment of National Parks<br></h4>
      <p>
      The idea of National Parks began in 1832, with artist George Catlin, who was inspired by the vast landscape of the Dakotas to find a way to preserve the government’s policy in a nation’s park. Roughly 30 years later, Ferdinand Hayden who was intrigued by the hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone. He convinced Congress to advocate Yellowstone as a National Park, and by 1872, President Grant signed off Yellowstone as "a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people." Following the years, more and more National Parks were established, and by 1916, President Woodrow Wilson established the National Park Service, which protected 35 parks across America. Today, there are over 400 National Parks across America, each preserving history, advocating for the environment, and protecting open land and wildlife. <br><br>
