    <p class="post-para">

       Welcome to <i>Sustainable One's</i> Blog!

       Our environment matters, and through our youth campaign to spread
       environmental awareness and fundraise to support organizations focused on
       saving the environment. We need your help in making our mission successful.

       <br><br>
       Our blog will update you with news and
       stories! Sign up to our newsletter to see when there is a new posting and to find out
       how you can decrease your carbon footprint.

       <br><br>
       We are currently in the process of filing for 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.
       In the meantime, we will be working hard to establish our campaign.

       <br><br>
       Some things we have planned include creating helpful infographics on environmental
       facts and publishing posts on <i>Medium</i>. We are working on making the website
       as user-friendly as possible, so stick around!

       <br><br>
       It only takes one idea to start a movement. <i>Sustainable One</i> hopes to encourage
       everyone to live a more sustainable life. We CAN do something.
