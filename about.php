      <h3>What do you do with the money you fundraise?</h3>
      <p>100% of net profits earned from our fundraising is donated to organizations that protect our environment.

      <h3>What is the Kickstarter for?</h3>
      <p>In order to ensure that 100% of profits earned from fundraising goes towards helping our environment, we created a Kickstarter so supporters can pledge money to help us purchase needed supplies.
        These supplies include art/shipping materials for our products and fees for hosting events/fundraisers. There are Kickstarter reward tiers to thank you for your support!</p>
      <h3>Why are you called Sustainable One?</h3>
      <p>In our efforts to save the Earth, we hope to reduce our carbon footprint to be one Earth and some stuff.</p>
      <h3>Where do you get your designs from?</h3>
