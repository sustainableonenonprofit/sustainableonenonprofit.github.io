      <p>In order to ensure that 100% of profits earned from fundraising goes towards helping our environment, we created a Kickstarter so supporters can pledge money to help us purchase needed supplies.
        These supplies include art/shipping materials for our products and fees for hosting events/fundraisers. There are Kickstarter reward tiers to thank you for your support!</p>
